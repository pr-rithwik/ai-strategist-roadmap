# The Four-Phase Learning Plan

This document outlines the curated sequence of courses and projects designed to efficiently build the skills of an AI Strategist.

### Phase 1: Foundational Vocabulary
*   **Course:** `AI Essentials for Google`
*   **Rationale:** Provides the essential, modern vocabulary for Generative AI, Responsible AI, and the overall landscape. Deliberately skipped other introductory courses to avoid redundancy and accelerate progress.

### Phase 2: The Prompting Deep Dive
*   **Course:** `Prompting Essentials with Google` Specialization
*   **Rationale:** Prompting is the most critical hands-on skill for an AI strategist. This specialization was chosen because it is a cohesive, structured package from a major tech company, providing a strong signal of expertise and replacing the need for 3-4 other standalone prompting courses.

### Phase 3: The Applied Tech Layer
*   **Course 1:** `Generative AI with LLMs` by DeepLearning.AI
    *   **Rationale:** The crucial bridge from "what" to "how." It covers the foundational technology (Transformers, RAG, Fine-Tuning) that every strategist must understand to make informed decisions.
*   **Course 2:** `LLM Engineering Master` on Udemy
    *   **Rationale:** A practical accelerator. After learning the "why" from the course above, this project-based course provides immediate, hands-on experience with the specific tools (LangChain, vector databases) listed on job descriptions.

### Phase 4: The Proof (Project Execution)
*   **Course:** `Machine Learning Projects` by DeepLearning.AI
    *   **Rationale:** Focuses on the practical, end-to-end lifecycle of a real-world ML project, covering scoping, data issues, and deployment considerations.
*   **Personal Projects:** This is where the other repositories in my portfolio are born, turning learned concepts into tangible assets.
