# The Four-Phase Learning Plan

This document outlines the curated sequence of courses and projects designed to efficiently build the skills of an AI Strategist.

### Phase 1: Foundational Vocabulary & ML Principles
*   **Course 1:** `AI Essentials for Google`
    *   **Rationale:** Provides the essential, modern vocabulary for Generative AI and Responsible AI.
*   **Course 2:** `Machine Learning Specialization` by DeepLearning.AI
    *   **Rationale:** Builds the fundamental, non-negotiable understanding of core ML concepts (Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, model evaluation, etc.). This is the theoretical bedrock upon which all modern AI is built and is a prerequisite for more advanced topics.

### Phase 2: The Prompting Deep Dive
*   **Course:** `Prompting Essentials with Google` Specialization
*   **Rationale:** Prompting is the most critical hands-on skill for an AI strategist. This specialization was chosen because it is a cohesive, structured package from a major tech company, providing a strong signal of expertise and replacing the need for 3-4 other standalone prompting courses.

### Phase 3: The Applied Tech Layer (LLMs)
*   **Course 1:** `Generative AI with LLMs` by DeepLearning.AI
    *   **Rationale:** The crucial bridge from foundational ML to modern LLM applications. It covers the specific technology (Transformers, RAG, Fine-Tuning) that every strategist must understand to make informed decisions. This follows the ML Specialization.
*   **Course 2:** `LLM Engineering Master` on Udemy
    *   **Rationale:** A practical accelerator. After learning the "why" from the course above, this project-based course provides immediate, hands-on experience with the specific tools (LangChain, vector databases) listed on job descriptions.

### Phase 4: The Proof (Portfolio Development)
*   **Rationale:** This phase is not a single course, but the ongoing process of turning learned concepts into tangible assets. The goal is to build a portfolio of public-facing projects that demonstrate strategic thinking and practical skill.
*   **Example Portfolio Projects:**
    1.  **The AI Concepts Atlas:** A GitHub project featuring curated mindmaps to visually explain the AI landscape.
    2.  **The AI Collaboration Playbook:** A collection of case studies on strategic prompt engineering.
    3.  **The AI Strategy Memo:** A written analysis of a business problem paired with a justified AI solution.
