# The AI Strategist's Learning Roadmap

### Introduction

The rise of Large Language Models has fundamentally shifted the AI landscape. Technical skill in coding algorithms is no longer the sole predictor of success; the premium is now on **strategic thinking**, **problem framing**, and the ability to connect AI capabilities to real-world business value.

This repository documents my personal journey and the deliberate, opinionated learning plan I designed to pivot from a traditional, code-focused background to a modern **AI Strategist** role.

### The Core Philosophy

This roadmap is built on a philosophy of **efficient, parallel learning**. It challenges the traditional "course-by-course" approach by adhering to three core principles:

1.  **Minimum Viable Knowledge:** Ruthlessly prioritizing the essential knowledge needed to be effective, avoiding redundant learning to maximize speed.
2.  **Parallel Learning:** Rejecting a sequential "learn then build" model in favor of a daily framework where learning, building, and professional development happen simultaneously.
3.  **Project-First Mindset:** The ultimate goal is not a certificate, but a portfolio of tangible projects. Every course is chosen based on its ability to fuel these projects.

### The Playbook

This repository contains the two core artifacts of this strategic plan:

*   **[The Learning Plan](./the_learning_plan.md):** The curated, four-phase roadmap of courses and specializations, including the rationale behind each choice.
*   **[The Daily Framework](./the_daily_framework.md):** The operational schedule designed to balance deep learning, practical application, and professional development.

*This project is one of several in my **Strategic AI Portfolio**. Each project documents a different aspect of my journey in AI strategy.*
